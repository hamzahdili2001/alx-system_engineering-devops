# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

### Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: March 3, 2024, 10:00 PM UTC
  - End Time: March 4, 2024, 2:00 AM UTC
- **Impact:**
  - Our web application experienced a slowdown, with a 30% increase in latency and a 20% rise in error rates, affecting user experience.
- **Root Cause:** 
  - Misconfigured caching layer led to an unexpected surge in database queries.

### Timeline:
- **Issue Detection:**
  - We noticed performance degradation through monitoring alerts.

  - Initially, we suspected a database overload and checked application logs and server metrics.
  - Later, we escalated the incident to specialized teams for database and caching layer investigation.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Initially, we focused on database-related issues and recent code changes.
- **Escalation:**
  - The incident was escalated to database administration and caching layer teams.
- **Resolution:**
  - The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the caching layer and optimizing database queries.

### Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:**
  - Misconfiguration in the caching layer caused it to bypass cache and excessively query the database.
- **Resolution:**
  - Adjustments were made to the caching layer configuration to properly cache data and reduce database queries.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement more robust monitoring to detect anomalies promptly.
  - Conduct regular audits of system configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Review and optimize caching layer configuration.
